2. Written for LPC 2148 ARM7 Microcontroller

# Components:
1. LED to check working
2. UART compatibility using MAX232 IC
3. Humidity Sensor using ADC
4. Humidity Control using Relay and external Humidifier
5. LCD Display on 4x20 LCD
6. LDR using ADC
7. Light control using Relay and bulb
8. Temperature Sensor (LM35) using ADC
9. Temperature control using fan (DC Motor using PWM)
10. 7 Segment Display to show fan speed.
